# Exercise 1, Getting Set Up

This workshop takes place completely in the browser, using web-based tools and platforms that are available for anyone to leverage.  We just need to do a couple quick set-up steps to get started in building our web-map.

### Accounts
In order to fully leverage the tools that are available to us we need to have accounts in two places, [GitHub](https://www.github.com) and [MapBox](https://www.mapbox.com).  Go ahead and sign up for those services, I'll wait.

Oh and make sure that you confirm your e-mail address for GitHub or the publishing tools that we're going to use won't work very well.

Ok, good, let's go to [exercise 2](/exercise2_fork_me.md).
