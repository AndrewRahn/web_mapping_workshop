# Exercise 3, Base Maps

That ugly green map is being provided by MapBox, one of the leaders in open source mapping right now, and arguably the best base map provider out there.  They have a number of tools that allow you to create and publish your own base maps using [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org) data as their backbone.  

The tools that they make available vary in complexity with the amount of flexibility and customizability that they provide.  We could spend an entire workshop and more talking about how to author maps from scratch, lucky for us they also let you start from one of their out of the box themes and create your own.  

With the free account, you get 50,000 map views / month which is way more than enough for personal projects.
